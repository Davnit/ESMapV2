# ESMapV2
This system was designed to monitor police activity and fire rescue calls in Orange County Florida through publicly available dispatch logs. It takes the location information from these logs, geocodes it, and displays the locations on a map, making relevant calls easier to find. 

A live implementation of this system can be found [here](http://davnit.net/esmap).
