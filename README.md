# ESMapV2
This system was designed to monitor police activity through publicly available dispatch logs. It takes the location information from these logs and displays it on a map, making relevant calls easier to find. It was expanded to include fire department and highway patrol calls.

The older implementation of this system can be found live [here](http://davnit.net/esmap). 
The current dev implementation of the new system can be found [here](http://davnit.net/esmap2).
